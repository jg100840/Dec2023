In this video you can see Barcelona VS Real Madrid, I hope you know
that Real Madrid wins in this game

Ronaldo was trained at Sporting Lisbon's youth academy and was signed by Manchester United at the age of 18. After initially playing in the right midfield position, he later moved to the left wing and, as United's star player, won, among other things, three English championships in a row and the UEFA Champions League in 2008. After his transfer to Real Madrid, the most expensive in football history at the time, Ronaldo scored an average of more than one goal per game in over 400 competitive games. He has been Real Madrid's record goalscorer since 2015. In 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 he won four more Champions League titles with the Madrilenians. He was the first player in the Champions League era to win five titles. From 2018, Ronaldo played for Juventus Turin and became Italian champions with the “Old Lady” in 2019 and 2020, among others. He returned to Manchester United at the end of August 2021 at the age of 36. He has been under contract with al-Nassr FC in Saudi Arabia since January 2023.

At international level, Ronaldo made his debut for the Portuguese national team at the age of 18. With Portugal, which at the time of his debut had only been able to qualify for three World Cup and European Championship tournaments, he subsequently took part in five European Championships (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2021) and World Championships (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022). As team captain, he led the previously untitled “Seleção” to win the 2016 European Championship and victory in the 2019 Nations League. Ronaldo holds the world records for the most international appearances and the most international goals. He also holds the European Championship records for most appearances (25) and goals (14) and is Portugal's World Cup record player with 22 appearances.

Ronaldo has been named World Player of the Year five times and European Player of the Year three times. With 183 appearances and 140 goals, he is the record player and record goalscorer in the Champions League, Europe's most prestigious club competition. He is the only footballer to win championships in England, Spain and Italy, to be named Footballer of the Year and to be top scorer. He also received the Golden Shoe four times as the best goalscorer in Europe. In 2020 Ronaldo was included in the Ballon d'Or Dream

Over the course of his career, Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has received five Ballon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or awards,[a] the most for a European player. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo holds the record for most goals and assists in the UEFA Champions League (140 and 42 respectively), and the record for most goals in the UEFA European Championship (14), its qualification stage (40), and the FIFA Club World Cup (7), as well as most goals scored in a UEFA Champions League season (17 in 2013–14), most international goals (128), and most appearances in a national team (204). He has scored a record 869 senior career goals for club and country. Moreover, he is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances.

Collectively, Ronaldo has won 34 senior trophies in his career. He has also attained one title from youth and at least five titles from friendly competitions. All in all he had won over 300 trophies and medals by January 2021, with some of them dating back to his childhood.[1]


Der Rekordtorschütze aller Zeiten bei Real Madrid
Position: Stürmer
Einsätze: 438 Pflichtspiele
Erzielte Tore: 451
Einsätze portugiesische Nationalmannschaft: 154 Spiele

Cristiano Ronaldo ist Teil der Geschichte von Real Madrid und wird für immer einer der größten Legenden aller Zeiten sein. Er wurde im Santiago-Bernabéu-Stadion am 6. Juli 2009 in Begleitung von Eusebio und Alfredo Di Stéfano als Real-Madrid-Spieler präsentiert und seitdem hörte er nicht auf, Tore zu erzielen: 451 Tore in 438 offiziellen Spielen mit Real Madrid (mehr als ein Tor pro Spiel). Zudem traf er in jedem Wettkampf: 312 in the Spanish Meisterschaft, 105 in the Champions League, 22 in the Königspokal, 6 in the Klub-Weltmeisterschaft, 4 in the Spanish Supercup and 2 in the European Supercup.

Niemand in der Geschichte des Vereins hat so viele Tore wie der portugiesische Stürmer erzielt. His achievements with Real Madrid include: 4 Champions Leagues, 3 Klub-Weltmeisterschaften, 3 European Supercups, 2 Spanish Meisterschaften, 2 Königspokale and 2 Spanish Supercups. Dazu muss man night 4 Ballon D'Or, 3 golden Schuhe, 2 The Best Trophäen, 3 UEFA-Trophäen für bester Spieler und 3 Pichichi-Trophäen zählen.

Eine Karriere voller Rekorde
Cristiano schaffte viele beeindruckende Rekorde im Laufe seiner neun Jahre bei Real Madrid: Rekordtorschütze aller Zeiten des Vereins, Rekordtorschütze aller Zeiten des Europapokals (er erzielte 105 Tore in der Champions mit Real Madrid); Rekordtorschütze von Real Madrid in the Spanish Liga (312), meisten Spiele mit mehr als drei Toren oder meisten Tore in the Geschichte der spanischen Liga (34); und die größte Anzahl an Toren für Real Madrid in one Season (61).

Als Real-Madrid-Spieler schaffte der Stürmer auch die höchste Anzahl an Toren in the Champions League (17) and gewann die Pichichi-Trophäe der Champions League 6 Mal. Präsident Florentino Pérez bezeichnete ihn als „der Erbe von Alfredo Di Stéfano“. Und auch wie Di Stéfano markierte er eine unvergessliche Etappe in der Geschichte des besten Vereins aller Zeiten.
